# 🧪 Hands-On Lab: Foundations of Prompt Engineering

---

## Goal

Learn why prompt engineering matters by directly experiencing how prompts change AI behavior.

---

## Prerequisites (2 minutes)

Participants should have access to:
- ChatGPT / Gemini / Claude (any one or more models)
- No coding knowledge required

---

## Part 1: Motivation – Why Prompt Engineering Matters

### Exercise 1: Same Question, Different Prompts

#### Step 1: Use a vague prompt

Explain artificial intelligence.

#### Observe
- Output length  
- Level of detail  
- Generic explanations  

#### Step 2: Use a structured prompt

Explain artificial intelligence to a non-technical audience  
in simple language using a real-world example.  
Limit the response to 5 bullet points.

#### Discussion Points
- How did clarity improve the output?  
- Which response is more usable?  
- What changed: the model or the instruction?

---

## Part 2: What Modern LLMs Can Do

### Exercise 2: Task Versatility Demo

Run the same model on different tasks.

#### Prompt A: Text Generation

Write a short story about a robot learning empathy.

#### Prompt B: Reasoning

A store sells pens at $2 each.  
If I buy 4 pens and get a $2 discount, how much do I pay?  
Explain step by step.

#### Prompt C: Role-Based Response

Act as a career coach and suggest 3 career paths  
for a computer science graduate.

#### Discussion Points
- Are these “hard-coded skills”?  
- What changes between tasks?  
- Why is instruction clarity critical?

---

## Part 3: Understanding LLMs (Intuition-Based)

### Exercise 3: Predictive Nature of LLMs

Complete this sentence:  
“Artificial intelligence will change the world by…”

Run the prompt **three times**.

#### Observe
- Are all outputs identical?  
- What parts change?  
- What remains consistent?

#### Key Insight
- LLMs predict likely next words  
- They don’t “know” answers — they generate them probabilistically  

---

## Part 4: Randomness in Outputs (Temperature)

### Exercise 4: Repeatability vs Creativity

Run the prompt multiple times:

Give a startup idea related to education.

Then run:

Give a highly creative and unconventional startup idea  
related to education.

#### Compare
- Creativity  
- Risky ideas vs safe ideas  
- Structure differences  

#### Teaching Point
- Higher randomness = more creativity  
- Lower randomness = more consistency  

---

## Part 5: Why Prompts Act Like Instructions

### Exercise 5: Ambiguity vs Direction

#### Prompt 1 (Ambiguous)

Summarize this article.

#### Prompt 2 (Instructional)

Summarize this article in 3 bullet points  
for a busy manager focused on decision-making.

#### Reflect
- How does the AI “guess” intent?  
- Which prompt reduced guessing?

---

## Part 6: What Counts as a Prompt

### Exercise 6: Prompt Components Awareness

Everything in a prompt influences the output, including:
- Roles  
- Formatting  
- Constraints  
- Examples  

#### Prompt Comparison

Write an email asking for a project deadline extension.

**vs**

Write a polite and professional email asking for a  
3-day project deadline extension.  
The tone should be respectful and concise.

#### Conclusion
A prompt is more than a question — it is a full instruction set.

---

## Part 7: Intuition Behind Effective Prompting

### Exercise 7: Prompt Improvement Iteration

Initial prompt:

Explain cloud computing.

Improve the prompt by adding:
- Audience  
- Scope  
- Length  
- Output format  

#### Sample Improved Prompt

Explain cloud computing to college students  
using a real-life analogy.  
Limit the explanation to 150 words.

#### Key Skill
Prompting is iterative, not one-shot.

---

## Part 8: Writing Simple, Structured Prompts

### Exercise 8: Prompt Formula Practice

#### Formula

Role + Task + Context + Output

#### Example Prompt

Act as a technical writer.  
Summarize the following article for beginners.  
Use bullet points and keep it under 100 words.

Rewrite this prompt for:
- Executives  
- Students  
- Developers  

---

## 🧪 Final Hands-On Tasks (Core Skills)

### Task 1: Rewrite Text

Rewrite the following paragraph to sound more professional  
and concise. Keep the meaning unchanged.

---

### Task 2: Summarize Content

Summarize the following text in 5 bullet points.  
Focus on key ideas only.

---

### Task 3: Extract Important Details

Extract dates, key people, and action items from  
the following text.  
Present the output in a table.

---

### Task 4: Compare Different LLM Responses

Run the same prompt on:
- ChatGPT  
- Gemini  
- Claude  

Explain machine learning to a 10-year-old.

#### Compare
- Tone  
- Simplicity  
- Accuracy  
- Creativity  

---

## Wrap-Up Reflection Questions

- Which prompt performed best? Why?  
- What changed the output most?  
- How would you reuse these prompts at work?

---

## Outcome of This Hands-On

Participants will:
- ✔ Understand how prompts guide AI  
- ✔ Write clearer and structured prompts  
- ✔ Predict how prompt changes affect output  
- ✔ Confidently use LLMs for real tasks
